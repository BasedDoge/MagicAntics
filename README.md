# MagicAntics

made for use on [play.undergroundantics.net](http://www.undergroundantics.net/). Adds spells, scrolls and spellbooks; useful in survival and combat.

## Installing

Build the .jar and place in the plugins folder of the server

## Playing

This plugin impliments 3 basic items used in spell-casting:

```
SpellScroll
```
Right click to use.
One use item that casts the spell described in its lore with no cooldown.


```
SpellBook
```
Right click to use.
When used, SpellBooks are consumed by the player and the spell corrisponding with the book will be added to the player's
'knowledge' for later use with SpellTome/s


```
SpellTome
```
Right click to cast spell.
Left click to cycle spell.
Right click on enchantment table to add or remove spells known to the player.
SpellTomes are craftable by the player and act as the forefront of MagicAntics, allowing easy casting and swapping of spells
with the disadvantages of:
- a player having to have previously learnt a spell for them to be able to cast it
- a cooldown on a spell after casting

###Commands
